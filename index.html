Jablonski is a NERD <br>
She also got ripped off by AT&T LOL<br>
She isn't a afternoon person<br>
Jablonski's powerpoints give cancer <br>
She also chased trucks cause she had no friends in her childhood <br>
Jablonski ran a 5K race in 2009 at the age of 55, she came in 9th in her age group with a time of 18 minutes and 56 seconds<br>
